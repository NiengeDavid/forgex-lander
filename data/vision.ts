  founderNotes1:
    "For years, I’ve worked closely with children who learn differently — especially those with dyslexia. And what I discovered was simple, yet life-changing: these children weren’t broken. They were brilliant. They didn’t need fixing. They needed freedom, Freedom to think differently, Freedom to learn in ways that made sense to them, Freedom to become who they were created to be. That’s where the vision for FORGE X Academy began.",
  founderNotes2:
    "I wanted to create a space where all children, neurodivergent or not  could be empowered to discover their strengths, think independently, and develop the skills that matter in today’s world. A place where traditional academics meet real-world relevance. A place where children aren’t just taught, but forged into ethical, innovative, and future-ready leaders. FORGE X Academy is the next chapter in our journey. What began as Dyslexia Help Learning Academy has evolved into a broader, bolder vision. One that includes all learners and leads them into a future shaped by creativity, courage, and purpose.",
  welcome:
    "At FORGE X, we don’t put children in boxes. We open doors, We believe thinking differently isn’t just acceptable — it’s powerful. Welcome to the future of education. Welcome to FORGE X Academy.",
